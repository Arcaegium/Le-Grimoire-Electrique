<p>In the world of Cirque Electrique, performers incorporate steampunk
and electropunk technologies to enhance their acts and combat the
spreading malevolence. Here are some examples of how each archetype
might appear and utilize these innovations:</p>
<h3 id="strongman"><strong>1. Strongman</strong> <img
src="media/41_Performer_Archetypes/image11.png"
style="width:1.79869in;height:3.15104in" /></h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Description:</strong> The Strongman of Cirque Electrique
is an imposing figure clad in a robust, steam-powered exoskeleton that
amplifies his natural strength. This exoskeleton is adorned with brass
and copper plates, featuring intricate gearwork and hydraulic pistons
that enable him to lift and manipulate enormous weights effortlessly. In
his performances, he showcases feats of strength, such as bending iron
bars and lifting massive weights with ease. Against evil forces, his
exoskeleton serves as a formidable defense, allowing him to engage in
close combat with corrupted entities, using its reinforced plating to
withstand attacks and its powerful hydraulics to deliver devastating
blows.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Visual Details:</strong> The Strongman’s imposing
presence is highlighted by the detailed steam-powered exoskeleton. Brass
and copper plates, intricate gearwork, and hydraulic pistons are
prominently featured.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Atmosphere: T</strong>he sound of hissing steam and the
clank of metal creates an immersive environment. His ability to
effortlessly lift massive weights or withstand blows adds a sense of awe
and power.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Powers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Boost/Lower Trait</strong> (*): Using the exoskeleton’s
enhancers to boost Strength, Agility, or Vigor for superhuman feats of
strength.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Protection</strong> (*): Activating reinforced plating as
<strong>protective armor</strong> (e.g. a burst of steam-hardening or
energy shield) to absorb damage.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Smite</strong> (*): Channeling the suit’s power into his
fists or a heavy prop, increasing melee damage (fluff as hydraulics
delivering extra force or electrifying a punch).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Havoc</strong> (+): Stomping the ground or clanging the
exoskeleton to produce a shockwave that knocks back or disrupts enemies
(fits the idea of overwhelming strength).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Deflection</strong> (+): Using mechanical reflexes or
magnetic fields in the suit to deflect attacks away (thematically a
steam-driven block or gadget that causes bullets to veer off).</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="flameblower"><strong>2. Flameblower</strong> <img
src="media/41_Performer_Archetypes/image3.png"
style="width:3.00573in;height:3.00573in" /></h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Description:</strong> The Flameblower performer wields a
steam-powered apparatus designed to project intense bursts of flame. His
suit is fitted with a custom-built flamethrower that channels a blend of
pressurized steam and incendiary compounds, creating controlled but
impressive fire effects. In his act, he performs daring fire-breathing
routines and intricate pyrotechnic displays. In battle, his Flameblower
becomes a potent weapon against dark entities, using its fiery arsenal
to scorch corrupted machinery and fend off malevolent creatures,
effectively wielding fire as both a tool of spectacle and a weapon of
defense.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Visual Details:</strong> The steam-powered Flameblower is
highlighted by its brass fittings and the burst of intense, controlled
flames. The performer’s suit gleams with the heat of the fire.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Atmosphere:</strong> The roaring fire, the smell of
burning fuel, and the scorching heat add both drama and danger to his
performance or combat scene<strong>.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Powers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Burst</strong> (*): Unleashing a cone of flame from the
custom flamethrower – perfect for short-range gouts of fire hitting
multiple targets (the classic flamethrower effect).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Blast</strong> (*): Shooting an explosive fireball or
pressurized flame bomb that affects a Medium Burst Template – fits his
pyrotechnic displays turned offensive.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bolt</strong> (*): Firing a focused jet of flame at a
single target (a stream of fire or incendiary projectile). This is a
simple and reliable ranged attack.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Light/Darkness</strong> (+): Using his gadgetry to
illuminate areas or snuff out lights. For example, he could ignite
something to light the scene or create black smoke to obscure (darkness)
as part of his show.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Elemental Manipulation</strong> (+): Minor pyrokinetic
tricks via tech, like igniting small fires, heating objects, or creating
puffs of smoke for show. Not powerful in combat, but very flavorful for
a fire-breather.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="escape-artist-master-of-chains"><strong>3. Escape Artist (Master
of Chains)</strong><img
src="media/41_Performer_Archetypes/image6.png"
style="width:2.52604in;height:2.52604in" /></h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Description:</strong> The Escape Artist, a master of
chains and locks, employs a range of clockwork gadgets to enhance her
escape routines. Her costume includes integrated, tiny mechanical
devices that can unlock or manipulate complex locks with precise
movements. In her performances, she is often seen emerging from
intricate, self-designed contraptions or elaborate traps. When
confronting dark forces, her escape skills are augmented with electrique
advancements, such as electrically powered lock-picking tools and
quick-release mechanisms, and electrified chain whips, all allowing her
to escape and outmaneuver enemies with ease, slipping through their
grasp and using her agility to strike from unexpected angles.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Visual Details:</strong> Focus on the clockwork gadgets
integrated into the Escape Artist’s costume and the electrified chain
whips. Her agile movements are emphasized along with the mechanical
efficiency of her tools.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Atmosphere:</strong> The sound of clicking locks and the
crackle of electricity in the chains enhances the tension and excitement
of her escapes and confrontations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Powers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Entangle</strong> (*): Tossing out electrified chains or
padlocks to bind enemies in place. Mechanically, this fits perfectly
(target is Entangled or Bound) and matches her use of chains to restrain
foes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Deflection</strong> (*): Her uncanny escape training
makes her hard to hit – flavored as graceful dodges or using a whirling
chain as a parrying tool. This power gives attackers a –2 (or –4) to hit
her, which is both thematically and mechanically strong for an evasive
character.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stun</strong> (*): Emitting a shocking surge through her
chains to jolt a target’s nervous system. This can momentarily
incapacitate an enemy (Stun power forces a Vigor roll or they become
Stunned) – very useful when slipping free or taking someone out
silently.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Teleport</strong> (+): A flavorful escape trick – a
concealed device that lets her vanish from bonds or traps in a flash of
electricity. Short-range teleportation could simulate her greatest
escapes (though as a Seasoned power, it’s a more advanced
trick).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Boost/Lower Trait</strong> (+): Enhancing her Agility or
Thievery skill with adrenaline or gadgetry to pick locks and escape even
faster, or <em>lowering</em> an enemy’s Agility (e.g. making their limbs
go numb with an electrical shock) to slip from their grasp.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="knife-thrower"><strong>4. Knife Thrower</strong> <img
src="media/41_Performer_Archetypes/image6.png"
style="width:2.33079in;height:2.33079in" /></h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Description:</strong> The Knife Thrower employs a set of
precision-engineered throwing knives, each designed with sharp,
streamlined edges and embedded with mechanical enhancements for accuracy
and stability. His act involves throwing these knives with deadly
precision at spinning targets or even his assistant, who is securely
bound in place. In battle, the knives can be electrified, poisoned, or
even affixed with small explosives to deliver a variety of effects to
enemies or disrupt corrupted machinery, making them a versatile tool for
both performance and combat. The precision of his throws ensures that he
can strike at critical points and neutralize threats
effectively.</p></li>
<li><p>Visual Details: Highlight the precision-engineered knives, their
sharpness, and mechanical enhancements. Describe the exactness of his
throws and the electrifying effects of the knives.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Atmosphere:</strong> The sound of knives slicing through
the air and the sparks from electrified blades create a tense and
thrilling atmosphere, emphasizing the skill and danger of the
act.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Powers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Bolt</strong> (*): Each thrown knife can be treated as a
ranged attack power. With Weird Science, he might have a gadget that
propels or energizes his knives, effectively making them Bolts (e.g. an
electrified knife or one that injects poison on hit). This is a staple
offensive power for single targets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Blast</strong> (*): Using knives rigged with small
explosives – throw one that detonates on impact, affecting an area
(Medium Blast Template). This matches his ability to disrupt groups or
machinery with explosive knives and is very potent
mechanically.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Smite</strong> (*): Applying a chemical or electrical
charge to his blades to increase their damage before throwing. Smite can
add +2 damage (+4 on a raise) to his knives – mechanically strong,
especially for a high-precision attacker ensuring each hit
counts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stun</strong> (+): Coating a knife with a paralytic toxin
or taser charge to shock a target into a Stunned state. This is a
flavorful special attack for incapacitating a foe without killing, using
the <em>Stun</em> power’s effects.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Blind</strong> (+): Flicking a blade that emits a flash
or powder on impact, obscuring a target’s vision (the <em>Blind</em>
power inflicts vision penalties). As a trick shot, this fits the idea of
a special trick knife and can set up an enemy for his next
attack.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Entangle</strong> (+): Throwing a knife attached to a
cable or bola, snagging an enemy to restrict movement. Not a typical use
of knives, but with a little gadget creativity, he could have a trick
blade that expands into a snare (mimicking the Entangle power).</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="clown"><strong>5. Clown</strong> <img
src="media/41_Performer_Archetypes/image9.png"
style="width:1.82708in;height:3.18924in" /></h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Description:</strong> The Clown blends traditional humor
with whimsical custom-made gadgets. His costume is a patchwork of bright
electric colors and mechanical elements, including a spring-loaded hat
and automated shoes that produce amusing sounds and movements. His acts
include slapstick comedy and absurd antics enhanced by these devices. In
the fight against evil, his gadgets become more than just props—they can
include defensive mechanisms like smoke screens or non-lethal,
electrified weapons disguised as part of his comedic routine, providing
both distraction and tactical advantage during skirmishes with dark
forces. At the same time, the Clown’s understanding of how to draw
attention, roll with a hit, and take a fall all make him a valuable
front-line combatant.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Visual Details:</strong> Detail the Clown’s vibrant,
mechanical costume with whimsical gadgets. The spring-loaded hat,
automated shoes, and other amusing devices are highlighted.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Atmosphere:</strong> Use comedic and surprising elements
like unexpected smoke screens or electrified props to create an
entertaining yet strategic combat scene. The Clown’s humor and gadgets
add a unique flair.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Powers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Deflection</strong> (*): The Clown’s unpredictable
movements and clever gadgets make him hard to hit. Think of a
spring-loaded jack-in-the-box that pops up to intercept an attack, or
the Clown simply pratfalling out of harm’s way (–2 to enemy attack rolls
is hugely helpful).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Confusion</strong> (*): Through slapstick antics or a
barrage of absurd tricks, the Clown can befuddle opponents, making them
Distracted and Vulnerable (the <em>Confusion</em> power). Mechanically,
that sets enemies up for defeat, and in-character it’s his specialty to
confuse and divert attention.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stun</strong> (*): A joy-buzzer handshake or a shocking
squirting flower delivers a jolt that stuns a target. This power is
mechanically strong (forcing a vigor roll or be Stunned) and fits the
Clown’s electrified props used in combat.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Obscure (Light/Darkness)</strong> (+): Using a smoke bomb
or gag umbrella to create a smokescreen (the <em>darkness</em> effect of
Light/Darkness). This is mostly for flavor and tactical retreats,
concealing the Clown or allies in a pinch.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Smite</strong> (+): Humorously “enchanting” a slapstick
weapon – for instance, overcharging his rubber chicken or mallet so it
hits extra hard. The Clown might not seem like a damage-dealer, but a
Smite (+2 damage) on his pie-launcher or boxing-glove gun can give his
strikes unexpected punch.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Relief</strong> (+): Comic relief can be literal – using
jokes or a comforting gag to rally an ally. The <em>Relief</em> power
removes Shaken or Fatigue. It’s a flavorful support move (perhaps
patting an ally with a comically oversized hand to snap them out of a
daze).</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="stilt-boxer"><strong>6. Stilt Boxer</strong> <img
src="media/41_Performer_Archetypes/image4.png"
style="width:1.88021in;height:2.82233in" /> </h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Description:</strong> The Stilt Boxer performs on
towering, steam-powered stilts, with boxing gloves on telescoping
mechanical fists that give him impressive height and reach advantages,
as well as excellent mobility. His stilts are equipped with hydraulic
joints that allow for powerful leaps and swift movements. In his act, he
demonstrates agility and strength, delivering high-flying kicks and
punches while balancing on these mechanical platforms. In combat, the
stilts enhance his ability to deliver crushing blows from above,
navigate over obstacles, and avoid ground-based attacks, making him a
formidable opponent for dark entities that seek to bring chaos.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Visual Details:</strong> Describe the towering,
steam-powered stilts with hydraulic joints in action. The height
advantage and powerful kicks are vividly portrayed.</p></li>
<li><p>Atmosphere: The clanking of the stilts and the sight of
high-flying attacks create a dramatic and dynamic scene, enhancing his
formidable presence and agility</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Powers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Boost/Lower Trait</strong> (*): Cranking up the stilt
hydraulics to boost his Strength or Agility. A boost to Strength makes
his punches hit harder; boosting Agility improves balance and Fighting
skill on those tall stilts. (Mechanically very useful for a melee
fighter.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sloth/Speed</strong> (*): Engaging a piston boost to
increase his speed in combat. The <em>Speed</em> effect lets him cover
ground or dodge quickly (and with the “Quickness” modifier, could even
reduce multi-action penalties – perfect for throwing rapid punches or
moving and striking).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Smite</strong> (*): Powering up his mechanical boxing
gloves with a burst of steam or electricity to increase damage. Smite
will make his next punch far more devastating – great for overcoming
tough foes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Deflection</strong> (+): Bobbing and weaving on stilts or
using his height advantage to evade attacks. This can be visualized as
him leaning out of reach or his stilts pivoting at the last second,
making opponents miss (Deflection’s defensive boon).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stun</strong> (+): Coming down from above with a crushing
blow that dazes the target. This isn’t a separate gadget power per se,
but you could treat a particularly thunderous strike (like a
spring-loaded downward punch) as the <em>Stun</em> power to knock an
enemy senseless.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>.</p>
<h3 id="ventriloquist"><strong>7. Ventriloquist</strong> <img
src="media/41_Performer_Archetypes/image5.png"
style="width:2.90334in;height:2.90334in" /></h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Description:</strong> The Ventriloquist uses advanced
mechanical puppets to perform acts of voice mimicry and interactive
dialogue. His puppets are sophisticated creations with intricate
clockwork mechanisms, some even powered by electricity, allowing them to
move with lifelike precision. During performances, the puppets engage in
elaborate skits and conversations. Against evil forces, the
ventriloquist’s puppets can be equipped with hidden compartments for
storing weapons or gadgets, and their mechanical nature allows for
discreet surveillance or delivery of messages, helping to gather
intelligence on dark forces or distract and disorient enemies during
confrontations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Visual Details:</strong> Focus on the sophisticated
mechanical puppets, their intricate clockwork mechanisms, and how they
interact with the Ventriloquist. Detail their lifelike movements and
hidden compartments.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Atmosphere:</strong> The puppets’ movements and dialogue
add a layer of intrigue and surprise, with the potential for espionage
or distraction enhancing the drama of the scene.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Note</strong>: This type of performer has taken on the
title of “Ventriloquist” because “Puppeteer” was already being commonly
used to refer to a type of Phantom.</p></li>
<li><p>Powers:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Puppet</strong> (*): The Puppeteer can attempt to take
control of any machine that is hosting Aetheric or Phantasmal energy!
With an eerie gadget or hypnotic voice, the Ventriloquist can impose his
will (the <em>Puppet</em> power lets him control a target’s actions on a
failed Spirit roll- in this case the target number will be defined by
the amount and purity of energy already in the machine). Mechanically
potent, this makes the Puppeteer invaluable when dealing with
phantom-infested machinery.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Summon Ally</strong> (*): Animating one of his mechanical
dolls as a fighting ally. For example, he flips a switch and a puppet
springs to life to aid the team (use <em>Summon Ally</em> to bring a
construct or animated marionette into play). This is very thematic (his
puppets aren’t just props, they can literally join the fray) and
mechanically gives the party an extra ally.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sound/Silence</strong> (+): Projecting his voice or
sounds through his puppet to mimic voices or create distractions, as
well as damping sound. He could throw his voice to make it seem like
there are allies in another direction (<em>Sound</em>), or hush the
gears of his puppet when sneaking (<em>Silence</em>). This power is
flavorful for a ventriloquist illusionist role.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Confusion</strong> (+): Using multiple puppets or an
especially baffling routine to confound enemies, making them unsure who
to target. Perhaps the puppets perform a disorienting skit or sudden
loud outburst – the <em>Confusion</em> power then leaves foes Distracted
and Vulnerable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Empathy</strong> (+): Through the puppet’s engaging
dialogue or intimidating persona, the Ventriloquist influences his
target’s emotions – mechanically, <em>Empathy</em> can give him +2 on
social attacks (after an opposed Spirit roll). This fits his ability to
play mind games with a talking puppet (whether soothing or
unsettling).</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="acrobat"><strong>8. Acrobat</strong> <img
src="media/41_Performer_Archetypes/image1.png"
style="width:2.91923in;height:2.91923in" /></h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Description:</strong> The Acrobat in Cirque Electrique
utilizes a combination of jetpacks, mechanical wings, and advanced
harnesses to perform gravity-defying stunts. Her costume includes
steam-powered apparatuses that allow for bursts of flight and
extraordinary aerial maneuvers and flips. In her performance, she soars
through the air with breathtaking agility and grace, deploying colored
smoke bombs and fireworks across her path. In the fight against dark
forces, the acrobat’s wings keep her above the fray and her fireworks
are replaced with grenades. Her expertise with ranged weaponry makes her
a deadly threat, enabling her to engage in aerial combat and avoid
ground-based attacks with ease.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Visual Details:</strong> Illustrate the jetpacks and
mechanical wings in action, with bursts of flight and graceful aerial
maneuvers. The acrobat’s costume should reflect advanced technology and
agility.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Atmosphere:</strong> The sight of her soaring through the
air with fireworks or grenades adds an element of high-flying spectacle
and excitement, enhancing the aerial combat scenes.</p></li>
<li><p>Powers:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Fly</strong> (*): Her mechanical wings enable true
flight. The <em>Fly</em> power (Pace 12″ flight) matches her jetpack
bursts and aerial acrobatics. Mechanically, flight is a huge advantage
for mobility and fits perfectly with her theme (even though Fly is a
Veteran power, it’s the ideal way to represent sustained jet-assisted
aerial movement).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Blast</strong> (*): Replacing showy fireworks with live
grenades – she can hurl an explosive at groups of enemies. This is the
<em>Blast</em> power, dealing area damage, and is highly effective in
combat (imagine her tossing a grenade from above into clustered
foes).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Deflection</strong> (*): Constant motion and aerial
agility make her hard to target. She can use <em>Deflection</em>
(flavored as swift, erratic flight patterns or a burst of chaff from her
devices) to cause ranged attacks to miss her while she’s aloft. This
keeps her safe while airborne and fits the high-flying daredevil
imagery.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Burst</strong> (+): For closer-range crowd control, she
could deploy a spray of shrapnel or flame from a gadget as she flies by
(the <em>Burst</em> power’s cone template could represent a wide
dispersal grenade or flamethrower burst fired downward). It’s a bit
redundant with Blast, but useful for a different area shape.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Blind</strong> (+): Utilizing a modified flash-bomb
firework to blind opponents (the <em>Blind</em> power). As part of her
act she had flash powder for effect; in battle this could be a tactical
blinder she drops on enemies to impair their vision while she swoops
around.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Obscure (Light/Darkness)</strong> (+): Popping a smoke
grenade midair to create a cloud (using the darkness effect) – a
flavorful way to cover allies’ approach or her own escape from a sticky
situation.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="juggler"><strong>9. Juggler</strong> <img
src="media/41_Performer_Archetypes/image7.png"
style="width:2.65104in;height:2.65104in" /></h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Description:</strong> The Juggler employs a set of
sophisticated, mechanized props that incorporate glowing orbs and
spinning gears. His act features intricate patterns and sequences of
juggling, enhanced by the kinetic energy and visual effects of his
props. When combating dark forces, the juggler’s props can be modified
into a wide variety of effects, both offensive and defensive, such as
energy shields, blinding flashes, fiery explosions, kinetic amplifiers,
and electrifying shocks, allowing him to neutralize threats or create
diversions while maintaining his impressive juggling routines.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Visual Details:</strong> Describe the sophisticated,
mechanized props, their glowing orbs, and spinning gears. The juggling
patterns and visual effects should be vividly portrayed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Atmosphere:</strong> The kinetic energy and visual
effects of the props create a mesmerizing and dynamic scene, with the
Juggler’s ability to adapt his props for combat adding an unpredictable
element.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Powers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Blast</strong> (*): With a flourish, the Juggler can toss
a volatile orb that explodes in a fiery blast mid-juggle. This is the
<em>Blast</em> power (medium blast area damage) and represents his
“fiery explosions” trick – very impactful in combat and well-suited to a
performer who handles explosive props.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Blind</strong> (*): One of his glowing juggling orbs can
flare with a blinding flash. As the <em>Blind</em> power, this imposes
vision penalties on enemies (great setup for the team). It fits the
described bright, mesmerizing visual effects of his act being turned
against foes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Protection</strong> (*): Spinning a ring of kinetic
energy or orbiting gadgets as an energy shield. Using the
<em>Protection</em> power, he can increase his (or an ally’s) Armor –
the “energy shield” mentioned in his description. Mechanically, that
makes him or a friend much harder to wound, and thematically it could be
him actively juggling defensive devices to intercept attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Boost/Lower Trait</strong> (*): Via kinetic amplifiers in
his props, he can boost his own effective strength, agility, and vigor –
for example, by juggling momentum-enhancing devices around them.
Conversely, he might <em>lower</em> an enemy’s Agility by hitting them
with a weighty juggling club that throws off their balance. This
versatility makes <em>Boost/Lower Trait</em> both a strong buff and
debuff in his toolkit.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bolt</strong> (+): Hurling a single charged sphere or
gear as a precise ranged attack (a <em>Bolt</em> of energy or force).
This could be an electrified ball that zaps a target. It’s
straightforward and likely something he can do as part of juggling
(flinging one of his items with deadly accuracy).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Damage Field</strong> (+): Keeping a halo of spinning,
sparking items around himself as a hazardous aura. This would use the
<em>Damage Field</em> power (causing continual damage to anyone
adjacent). It’s a flashy defensive move – any foe who comes in close
gets whacked or shocked by the orbiting juggled objects.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stun</strong> (+): Charging one of his juggling props
with kinetic force and bouncing it off an enemy’s head to daze them.
This could emulate the <em>Stun</em> power, fitting the idea of using
kinetic force in creative ways (perhaps an orb that delivers an
electrical shock on impact, stunning the target).</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="animal-tamer"><strong>10. Animal Tamer</strong> <img
src="media/41_Performer_Archetypes/image2.png"
style="width:3.12691in;height:2.0846in" /> </h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Description:</strong> The Animal Tamer works with a
collection of steam-powered, mechanically enhanced beasts that have been
trained to perform alongside him. His attire includes protective gear
and control devices that enable him to manage and direct these creatures
with precision. In his act, the animals display remarkable tricks and
synchronized routines. In combat, the tamer’s animals are equipped with
reinforcing modifications, such as armor and metallic claws, allowing
them to defend against and repel malevolent entities with a variety of
tactics.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Visual Details:</strong> Focus on the steam-powered,
mechanically enhanced beasts and the tamer’s control devices. The
animals’ armor and metallic claws should be highlighted.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Atmosphere:</strong> The roar of the beasts and the sound
of their mechanical enhancements create a powerful and commanding
presence, making their performance and combat scenes more
intense.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Power:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Beast Friend</strong> (*): The core power for an animal
tamer – he can control beasts. Here it’s flavored as using devices and
training to direct his mechanical beasts’ actions (rules-wise, <em>Beast
Friend</em> lets him command natural animals with simple orders – the GM
might allow it for his tech-augmented beasts as well). This is key to
making his pets effective in battle.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Summon Ally</strong> (*): If his creatures are not always
by his side, he could summon a mechanical beast when needed. For
example, blowing a special whistle to call forth a clockwork lion from
the shadows. <em>Summon Ally</em> would conjure an allied creature (the
cost based on its Size/abilities). This is mechanically potent, as it
brings extra fighters to the field, and fits if he occasionally
“unleashes” new animals from cages or hidden compartments.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Boost Trait</strong> (*): Rousing his animal with a
stimulant or tweaking its machinery to boost its Strength or Vigor. For
instance, he hits a switch on his bear’s harness to enrage it, making it
hit harder. This can also apply to boosting his own Riding or Persuasion
when dealing with beasts (to symbolize his exceptional
rapport).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fear</strong> (+): Letting loose a fearsome roar in
unison with a beast or using a gadget to amplify a creature’s snarl,
causing enemies to make a Fear check. The <em>Fear</em> power fits the
dramatic terror of a roaring cybernetic tiger on the battlefield – a
great crowd-control effect, though situational.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Healing</strong> (+): Tending to his animal companions
with quick mechanical repairs or medicinal tonics. <em>Healing</em> can
patch up Wounds on his beasts (or allies). It’s more of a support role
for the tamer – flavorful as the “veterinarian/inventor” side of him –
but can be clutch to keep his favorite creature in the fight.</p></li>

style="width:3.04688in;height:3.04688in" /> </h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Description:</strong> The Snake Charmer uses a collection
of mechanical snakes that are enhanced with electrique technology. These
mechanical creatures can perform complex movements and are equipped with
various gadgets and weaponry. In his act, the charmer manipulates the
snakes in synchronized routines. In combat, the mechanical snakes can be
used for reconnaissance, as they can navigate tight spaces, or they can
be used to trip or restrict opponents and deliver poison or shocks,
along with other offensive capabilities, making them versatile tools for
both performance and battle.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Visual Details:</strong> Describe the mechanical snakes
with their electrique enhancements. The synchronized movements and
weaponry of the snakes should be detailed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Atmosphere:</strong> The mechanical snakes’ movements and
the Charmer’s manipulation create a captivating and eerie atmosphere,
enhancing the visual and tactical impact of his performance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Powers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Entangle</strong> (*): Sending his mechanical snakes to
coil around an enemy’s legs or body, immobilizing them. This directly
mirrors the <em>Entangle</em> power (binding foes so they can’t move and
are easier to hit) and is highly thematic – the image of snakes wrapping
up a target is spot on.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stun</strong> (*): One of the snakes strikes with an
electrifying bite, stunning the target’s nervous system. This uses the
<em>Stun</em> power, which forces a vigor roll or leaves the victim
Stunned. Mechanically, that’s strong, and it fits the idea of the snakes
delivering electrical shocks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lower Trait</strong> (*): A mechanical viper injects
venom that weakens its prey – for example, lowering the target’s Vigor
or Strength. <em>Lower Trait</em> can temporarily reduce an enemy’s
attribute or skill, reflecting the debilitating effect of poison. This
can turn the tide by softening up tough enemies (and feels appropriate
for venomous snakes).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Slumber</strong> (+): A specialized toxin from the snake
puts the victim to sleep. This would be the <em>Slumber</em> power –
instead of magical sandman dust, it’s a sedative venom that knocks
people out for an hour or until shaken awake. A flavorful non-lethal
option that highlights the charmer’s mastery over venom.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Burrow</strong> (+): The snakes’ slim design could allow
them to slither through tiny cracks or underground. Using
<em>Burrow</em> on a snake ally would let it disappear into the earth
and pop up elsewhere (useful for infiltration or surprise attacks). It’s
a niche power, but it fits the idea of a snake going where others
can’t.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Summon Ally</strong> (+): If the Snake Charmer carries a
basket of mechanical serpents, he might “deploy” another snake when
needed. <em>Summon Ally</em> can represent releasing an extra snake into
the fray (the ally being a small construct). Mechanically, additional
allies are useful, though the charmer likely already has his pets
without needing to summon.</p></li>

<h3 id="illusionist"><strong>12. Illusionist</strong> <img
src="media/41_Performer_Archetypes/image12.png"
style="width:2.24479in;height:3.36013in" /> </h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Description:</strong> The Illusionist uses electrique
devices to create elaborate visual deceptions and illusions. His costume
includes integrated projectors and holographic generators that enable
him to conjure realistic, ephemeral images. During his act, he performs
feats of illusion that captivate and mystify the audience. In combat,
the Illusionist’s devices can create diversions, conceal his allies, or
mislead enemies, making him a valuable asset in tactical scenarios. His
ability to create convincing illusions can confuse and disorient foes,
turning the tide of battle in favor of the circus.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Visual Details:</strong> Focus on the electrique devices
and holographic generators integrated into the Illusionist’s costume.
The visual deceptions and illusions should be vividly
portrayed<strong>.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Atmosphere:</strong> The creation of illusions and visual
effects adds a layer of intrigue and unpredictability, making the
Illusionist’s performances and combat scenes both mesmerizing and
strategic.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Powers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Illusion</strong> (*): The signature ability – creating
realistic visual (and possibly auditory) illusions to deceive enemies.
The <em>Illusion</em> power allows him to produce images that look real.
This aligns perfectly with his holographic projectors that conjure
“ephemeral images.” Mechanically, it can fool opponents or conceal
hazards, very on-theme and useful.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Invisibility</strong> (*): Bending light around herself
or an ally to become unseen. With the Illusionist’s tech, this could be
a sort of cloaking field. <em>Invisibility</em> is a powerful Seasoned
power, but it fits his role of concealing allies and himself in combat
for tactical advantage.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Disguise</strong> (+): Projecting an illusion over a
person to make them look like someone else. The <em>Disguise</em> power
is essentially a specialized illusion that sticks to a target. This is
great for infiltration or escape, aligning with the Illusionist’s
ability to “mislead enemies” and assume different appearances during
acts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Confusion</strong> (+): Crafting a rapid series of
illusory effects or phantom sounds that distract and confuse foes. While
<em>Illusion</em> can do a lot narratively, the <em>Confusion</em> power
has a straightforward mechanical effect (Distracted + Vulnerable on
targets) that could represent an illusionary assault on the senses. It’s
a nice flavorful addition to truly befuddle an opponent with
overwhelming sensory tricks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Deflection</strong> (+): Surrounding himself with mirror
images or light-bending fields to throw off enemy aim. As a power,
<em>Deflection</em> would imply minor illusionary duplicates or
refractions that impose a penalty on attacks against him. It’s
thematically appropriate (classic stage magicians seem to be where
they’re not) and helps survivability.</p></li>
</ul></li>

<h3 id="trick-shooter"><strong>13. Trick Shooter</strong> <img
src="media/41_Performer_Archetypes/image10.png"
style="width:2.79328in;height:2.79328in" /></h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Description:</strong> The Trick Shooter wields a set of
precision-engineered firearms and clockwork weaponry, each designed for
accuracy and adaptability. His act includes sharpshooting and elaborate
trick shots. In combat, his firearms can be customized for various
effects, such as rapid-fire bursts, electrified shots, or specialized
ammunition. The Trick Shooter’s skills make him effective at both
long-range engagements and close-quarters combat, using his weaponry to
strike down dark entities with pinpoint precision.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Visual Details:</strong> Highlight the
precision-engineered firearms and clockwork weaponry, including their
adaptability and effects. The Trick Shooter’s sharpshooting skills and
customizations should be detailed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Atmosphere:</strong> The sound of firearms and the
precision of trick shots create a thrilling and intense atmosphere,
enhancing the Trick Shooter’s role in both performance and
combat.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Powers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Bolt</strong> (*): For precision shots with special
effects – e.g. a charged bullet or lightning round. <em>Bolt</em> is a
go-to ranged attack power. The Trick Shooter could have a custom pistol
that fires energy bolts or carries different ammo types (shock,
incendiary, etc.), making this more than just a regular Shooting roll.
It’s mechanically efficient and versatile (can even fire multiple bolts
at extra cost for a “fan the hammer” feel).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Blast</strong> (*): Loading an explosive cartridge or
grenade shell to hit multiple targets. This mimics the <em>Blast</em>
power, letting him do area damage (maybe a rifle grenade or a trick shot
that ricochets into a group and blows up). Mechanically, this gives him
crowd-control capability that a normal shooter wouldn’t have without
explosives.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Boost/Lower Trait</strong> (*): Tinkering with a scope or
using a performance enhancer to boost his Shooting trait for a short
time. With <em>Boost Trait (Shooting)</em>, the Trick Shooter can
dramatically improve his accuracy (raise his die type, which is huge for
making those impossible shots). This could be a stimulant injection or a
clockwork targeting mechanism – mechanically optimal for trick shots and
called shots.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Burst</strong> (+): Unleashing a spray of bullets in a
wide fan. The <em>Burst</em> power (a cone attack for 2d6 damage) can
represent him using a trick like fanning a six-gun or a shotgun blast.
It’s a bit redundant since he likely can just do automatic fire with a
normal gun, but as a Weird Science power it could allow a controlled
cone of effect even with a weapon that normally doesn’t do
that.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Smite</strong> (+): Temporarily enhancing his firearm’s
rounds for extra punch. For example, activating a dial on his rifle to
give all shots enhanced damage. <em>Smite</em> isn’t usually needed for
a gunslinger (since they can just shoot more), but if expecting a
high-toughness foe, this ensures each hit counts harder. A raise can be
decisive against armored targets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Farsight</strong> (+): Utilizing a high-tech scope or
goggles to see distant targets clearly. <em>Farsight</em> reduces Range
penalties by enhancing vision. This power is great for a sniper-type
Trick Shooter, letting him hit targets at extreme range with ease – a
mechanical edge in ranged combat and a logical gadget for a trick shot
expert.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Entangle/Blind/Stun</strong> (+): As additional trick
shots, he could have net bullets, flashbang rounds, or taser shots. For
instance, a net round that <em>Entangles</em> a foe, a dazzling flare
round to <em>Blind</em> them, or a taser bullet that <em>Stuns</em> on
impact. These are flavorful options that give him non-lethal or control
tools beyond just dealing damage. They might see less use (hence marked
flavor), but they fit the concept of having <em>specialized ammunition
for any scenario</em>.</p></li>
