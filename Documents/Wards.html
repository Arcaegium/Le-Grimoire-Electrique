<h3 id="social-dynamics-and-payment-rituals"><strong>Social Dynamics and
Payment Rituals</strong></h3>
<p>The use and maintenance of Wards vary significantly across different
social classes, reflecting the stark disparities within society.</p>
<section><li><p><strong>Working Class:</strong></p>
<section><li><p><strong>Daily Contributions:</strong> For the working class, life
includes a daily visit to the neighborhood Ward to pay their share of
the energy cost. Contributing Copper Aetherium, these payments are vital
for maintaining the Ward's energy field, as the lower quality of the
coins means they are quickly consumed by the device.</p></li><li><p><strong>Social Pressure:</strong> Since everyone in the
neighborhood relies on the Ward for protection, there is a strong social
expectation to contribute. Failure to do so often results in being
ostracized or even expelled from the community. The daily toll is just
one of many expenses that leave the working class with little to no
savings.</p></li></section></li><li><p><strong>Middle Class:</strong></p>
<section><li><p><strong>Weekly Contributions:</strong> The middle class enjoys a
slightly more comfortable routine, making weekly payments to the
neighborhood Ward using Cobalt Aetherium. These coins, being of higher
quality, provide ten times the energy of Copper Aetherium, allowing for
less frequent contributions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Social Appearances:</strong> While there is still an
expectation to contribute, in middle-class neighborhoods, the act of
paying one’s dues becomes more about maintaining social appearances. The
regularity and manner of contributions are closely observed, though the
consequences for failing to contribute are less severe than in
working-class areas.</p></li></section></li><li><p><strong>Poor:</strong></p>
<section><li><p><strong>Desperate Contributions:</strong> In the poorest
neighborhoods, the situation is dire. Wards are barely kept active by
the desperate contributions of residents, who scrape together whatever
coins they can find. Even children, aware of the importance of the Ward,
rush to contribute their meager earnings.</p></li><li><p><strong>Community Resilience:</strong> Despite the lack of
external oversight, there is an unspoken understanding among residents
that the Ward must be maintained at all costs. The shared struggle to
keep the Ward active fosters a strong sense of community
resilience.</p></li></section></li><li><p><strong>Upper Class:</strong></p>
<section><li><p><strong>Monthly Contributions or Private Wards:</strong> The
upper class typically makes monthly payments to their neighborhood Ward,
often in the form of Opal or Gold Aetherium. Some, however, have the
luxury of maintaining private estate Wards, allowing them greater
independence and security.</p></li><li><p><strong>Elegance and Exclusivity:</strong> In these affluent
areas, Wards are not just functional; they are also designed to be
aesthetically pleasing, often integrated seamlessly into the landscape
or architecture of the estate. The contribution process is discreet,
with little to no social pressure, as wealth easily covers the necessary
expenses.</p></li></section></li></section>

<h3 id="variations-in-ward-appearance"><strong>Variations in Ward
Appearance</strong></h3>
<p>Wards, while fundamentally similar in function, differ significantly
in appearance depending on their surroundings and the social class of
the area they protect.</p>
<section><li><p><strong>Working and Poor Class Wards:</strong></p>
<section><li><p>These Wards are typically older, dirtier, and show signs of wear
and tear. They are often constructed from repurposed materials, with
visible patches and makeshift repairs. The protective energy fields they
generate are weaker and more prone to fluctuations, reflecting the lower
quality of the Ether supplied.</p></li></section></li></section>

</blockquote>
<section><li><p><strong>Middle Class Wards:</strong></p>
<section><li><p>Wards in middle-class neighborhoods are better maintained and
slightly more refined. They are often housed in small, purpose-built
structures, with modest decorative elements that reflect the community’s
relative prosperity. The energy fields are stable, providing reliable
protection with minimal disruption.</p></li></section></li></section>

</blockquote>
<section><li><p><strong>Upper Class Wards:</strong></p>
<section><li><p>These Wards are masterpieces of Aetherial design, often
custom-built to complement the luxurious surroundings of an estate. They
are constructed from the finest materials, with intricate engravings and
glowing neon accents that highlight their elegance. The energy fields
are powerful and stable, providing near-impenetrable
protection.</p></li></section></li></section>

<h3 id="mobile-wards-for-circuses"><strong>Mobile Wards for
Circuses</strong></h3>
<p>Traveling circuses rely on mobile Wards to protect their caravans and
campsites. These portable devices are loaded onto the back of a carriage
and require a skilled Warden to operate. The demands on these Wards are
significant, as they must maintain a strong protective field while in
constant motion, consuming large amounts of Aetherium in the
process.</p>
<section><li><p><strong>Design and Functionality:</strong></p>
<section><li><p>Mobile Wards are robust and versatile, designed to withstand the
rigors of travel. They are larger than stationary Wards, due to
reinforced structures and additional energy storage compartments. The
energy collector is designed to be more sensitive, drawing in phantasmal
energy from a wider area to maintain the field.</p></li></section></li><li><p><strong>Energy Consumption:</strong></p>
<section><li><p>Due to the high energy demands, circuses often pool resources to
fuel the Ward, with performers and staff contributing their Pax
Aetherium. The Warden’s skill is crucial in managing the energy flow and
ensuring that the protective field remains active throughout the
journey.</p></li></section></li><li><p><strong>Aesthetics:</strong></p>
<section><li><p>Despite their utilitarian purpose, mobile Wards often feature
decorative elements that align with the circus’s theme. These can
include vibrant paintwork, glowing neon lights, and intricate patterns
that add a touch of flair to the otherwise industrial device.</p></li></section></li></section>
