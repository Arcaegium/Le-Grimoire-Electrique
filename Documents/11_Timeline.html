Ohm's Manuscript - The Spark Ignites</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Event Overview:<br/>
</strong>In 1827, the world was forever changed when Georg Ohm published
<em>The Galvanic Circuit</em>, a manuscript that became known as “The
Ohm Manifesto.” This document laid the foundational principles of
electrical theory, sparking a new era of invention and technology.
Dubbed "The Spark," this period saw an unprecedented acceleration in
scientific inquiry and technological advancement.</p>
<p><strong>Impact:<br/>
</strong>The manuscript's publication led to the integration of early
electrical theories into existing steampunk innovations. The resulting
advancements ranged from improved steam engines to the first practical
electrical devices, creating a fusion of traditional and new
technologies. This era laid the groundwork for what would later become
the Electrique revolution.</p>
<p><strong>Legendary Figure:<br/>
Georg Ohm</strong> - Often regarded as the "Father of Modern
Electricity," Ohm's theories paved the way for the technological
advancements that defined the 19th century. His name is synonymous with
the principles of electricity that fueled the rise of Electrique

<h4 id="s-1850s-era-of-steam-and-electricity"><strong>1830s-1850s: Era
of Steam and Electricity</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Event Overview:<br/>
</strong>The decades following Ohm's publication were marked by
significant advancements in both steam and electrical technologies.
Steam-powered engines became more sophisticated, and the first
automatons—a blend of clockwork and early electrical circuits—were
introduced. The diesel engine, a new innovation, began to take shape,
promising even more industrial might.</p>
<p><strong>Impact:<br/>
</strong>This era saw the rise of vast industrial cities, with factories
churning out goods powered by steam and electricity. However, this
progress came at a cost. The working class endured grueling conditions,
while the elite reaped the benefits. The disparity between the classes
grew, setting the stage for future social upheavals.</p>
<p><strong>Legendary Figure:<br/>
Isambard Kingdom Brunel</strong> - A visionary engineer, Brunel's work
in creating massive steam-powered infrastructure projects, including
railways and steamships, defined the era. His designs pushed the

steampunk machinery is still felt in the modern world of Cirque
Electrique.</p>
<h4 id="growing-industrial-tensions"><strong>1861: Growing Industrial
Tensions</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Event Overview:<br/>
</strong>As industrialization intensified, tensions rose between the
burgeoning industrial powers and their colonial interests. The divide
between the elite and the working class deepened, with the latter facing
ever-worsening conditions. This period was marked by labor strikes,
protests, and a growing sense of unrest among the working
population.</p>
<p><strong>Impact:<br/>
</strong>The societal stratification created during this time led to
widespread dissatisfaction among the lower classes. The seeds of
rebellion were sown, as the working poor began to question the
legitimacy of a system that benefited only the elite.</p>
<p><strong>Legendary Figure:<br/>

period. Her fiery speeches and relentless organizing efforts helped to
unite the working class in their struggle for fair treatment. Although
the full impact of her work wouldn't be felt until later decades, she is
remembered as a key figure in the fight for workers' rights.</p>
<h4 id="the-world-shifts"><strong>1863: The World Shifts</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Event Overview:<br/>
</strong>Confederate soldiers claimed it was the Native Americans
performing a ritual during the Battle of Gettysburg. Egyptians claimed
it was the Europeans’ raiding of the Tomb of Ahhotep in Egypt. Some
argued it was the super-explosion of Mt. Vesuvius, which had re-awoken
in 1861. No one knows what the real catalyst was, but whatever tipped
the scales, a critical moment in history occurred when, in 1863, the
first rift opened between the mortal realm and the Realm of the Damned.
This rift allowed Phantoms—malevolent entities feeding on negative
emotions—to enter the world, introducing a new and terrifying threat to
humanity.</p>
<p><strong>Impact:<br/>
</strong>The sudden appearance of Phantoms threw societies into chaos.
With no understanding of these entities or how to combat them, fear
spread like wildfire. This event marked the beginning of a new era where
the threat of the supernatural loomed over the industrial world.</p>
<p><strong>Legendary Figure:<br/>
Dr. Elias Thorncroft</strong> - A pioneering researcher in the field of
Aetherics, Dr. Thorncroft was among the first to study the Phantoms that

for future developments in warding technology and the eventual discovery
of Ether.</p>
<p><strong>General Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain</strong> - A hero of the
Battle of Gettysburg, Chamberlain's leadership and bravery became
legendary. However, his story took a darker turn as he became one of the
first known victims of a Phantom attack. His tragic fate is often cited
as the first indication of the severity of the Phantom threat.</p>
<h4 id="initial-chaos-and-discovery"><strong>1864-1866: Initial Chaos
and Discovery</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Event Overview:<br/>
</strong>In the years following the Battle of Gettysburg, the world
crumbled as it struggled to understand the nature of Phantoms. With only
the barest of defenses against the Phantoms, millions died, hundreds of
smaller cities and rural areas were destroyed, and nations toppled.
People gathered in the larger cities where they could pool their limited
warding technology to evade the Phantoms and meek out survival. Early
scientific investigations revealed that phantom entities were frequently
linked to specific frequencies and seemed to be drawn toward negative
emotions. However, their true nature remained a mystery, leading to
widespread panic and paranoia.</p>
<p><strong>Impact:<br/>
</strong>The uncertainty surrounding Phantoms led to the creation of new
institutions dedicated to studying and combating these entities. Early
forms of warding technology were developed, but their effectiveness was
limited. This period of chaos highlighted the need for more advanced
solutions to the Phantom threat.</p>

local ambient energies was instrumental in the early efforts to combat
Phantoms. He laid the groundwork for the development of modern warding
practices.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Helena Mercurial</strong> - A brilliant scientist and
arcanist, Dr. Mercurial was one of the first to purify phantasmal
energies. Her work laid the groundwork for the development of Ether and
Electrique technology. Despite her successes, she faced significant
opposition from traditionalists who feared her experiments. After facing
mush pushback in the scientific field, Dr. Mercurial later decided to
found the Aether Circus to fund her research without having to compete
with narrow minded institutionalists for grants.</p>
<h4 id="the-invention-of-ether"><strong>1867: The Invention of
Ether</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Event Overview:<br/>
</strong>In 1867, a breakthrough occurred when, leapfrogging off Dr.
