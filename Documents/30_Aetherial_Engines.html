<p><strong>Design Elements:</strong></p>
<section><li><p><strong>Material and Structure:</strong></p>
<section><li><p>The frame is a latticework of tarnished copper and brass,
featuring large, exposed gears that turn slowly as the device functions.
Braided copper wires hum with low, pulsating energy, and thick leather
straps, reinforced with brass rivets, secure the device to the wearer’s
arm, adding to its rough-hewn, industrial aesthetic.</p></li></section></li><li><p><strong>Phantasmal Energy Collector:</strong></p>
<section><li><p>A small, vented chamber resembling a miniature smokestack sits
atop the gauntlet. This collector draws in phantasmal energy, pulsing
with an eerie, dim light, a clear visual indicator of the engine’s
work.</p></li></section></li><li><p><strong>Ether Storage and Coin Minting:</strong></p>
<section><li><p>A cylindrical chamber made of frosted glass and copper stores and
distills raw energy into a thick, sluggish liquid form of Crude Ether.
Inside, small mechanical arms collect drops of this liquid and deposit
them into a separate compartment where they join together and solidify
into the form of a coin.</p></li></section></li><li><p><strong>Coin Extrusion:</strong></p>
<section><li><p>At the base of the gauntlet, near the wrist, a slot framed by a
toothed, brass aperture extrudes the minted Copper Aetherium. Small
bursts of steam occasionally escape as each coin is pressed and formed,
accompanied by a hammering sound reminiscent of traditional coin
minting.</p></li></section></li><li><p><strong>Size and Wear:</strong></p>
