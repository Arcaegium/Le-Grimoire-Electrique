<p><strong>World Overview: A Dark Reflection of Progress</strong></p>
<p>In the world of <em>Cirque Electrique</em>, the streets of Victorian
England are veiled in a thick shroud of industrial smoke, the air tinged
with the metallic scent of machinery and the lingering chill of
something far more sinister. It is a world on the brink of both
incredible technological advancement and unimaginable horror. The clang
of iron and the hum of newly harnessed electricity echo through
cobblestone streets, but beneath this façade of progress lies a grim
reality—humanity's survival now hinges on forces beyond its control,
forces that hunger for the very souls of the living.</p>
<p>This is a world where the elegance of Gothic Victorian architecture
is marred by the creeping tendrils of steampunk and electropunk
innovations, each invention a testament to human ingenuity and
desperation. Towering factories belch smoke into the skies, their gears
and pistons fueled not only by coal but by something far more
potent—<em>Ether</em>, a substance distilled from the very essence of
the dead. What was once a symbol of human achievement has become a
harbinger of doom, as the line between the living and the dead blurs
with every turn of the wrench and spark of the generator.</p>
<p>The cities of <em>Cirque Electrique</em>, now few and far between,
are labyrinthine bastions of safety from the shadows themselves given
form: Phantoms—malevolent entities that slipped through the rifts
between worlds. These phantoms are not mere echoes of the dead but
beings driven by a hunger for the suffering and fear of the living.
Their presence is felt in every flickering gaslight and every creaking
floorboard, a reminder that the cost of progress is steep, and the dead
are never truly at rest.</p>
<p>Society, fractured and divided, clings to the fragile hope offered by
technological marvels, even as these very innovations inch them closer
to the abyss. The upper echelons revel in the splendor of their
mechanical wonders, their lives insulated by wealth and power, while the
masses toil in the shadow of the machines that keep the Phantoms at bay.
Yet, the illusion of control is just that—an illusion. For every new
invention, every new application of Ether, there is a corresponding rise
in the malevolent forces that now stalk the Earth.</p>
<p>The world is teetering on the edge, where the pursuit of progress and
the fear of the unknown have become inextricably linked. The great
circuses, once merely spectacles of wonder, now serve as the last line
of defense against the horrors that lurk just beyond the veil. These
traveling troupes, cloaked in the guise of entertainment, are, in truth,
the only force capable of standing against the darkness. Yet, their
existence is precarious, their efforts seen as both heroic and heretical
by a society that fears as much as it venerates them.</p>
<p>In <em>Cirque Electrique</em>, there is no clear distinction between
savior and sinner, progress and peril. The cities, once beacons of
civilization, are now brief respites on the battlegrounds of a war that
few understand and fewer still survive. The air is thick with the
tension of a world on the brink, where every flicker of light could
herald salvation or damnation, and the only certainty is that the cost
of survival will be paid in blood and souls.</p>
<p>The world is not merely a backdrop for stories of heroism and
horror—it is a living, breathing entity, pulsing with the energies of
the dead and the desperation of the living. In this dark reflection of
Victorian England, where the weight of history presses down upon the
present, the choices of individuals and the machinations of fate are
intertwined in a dance as beautiful as it is deadly.</p>
