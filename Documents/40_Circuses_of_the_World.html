<p>Circuses</p>
<p>Circuses in the world of Cirque Electrique are far more than just
traveling troupes of entertainers; they are organizations of fearless
and talented individuals that have banded together to combat the
malevolent forces of Phantoms that threaten the world. As one might
expect, they are under the leadership of their Ringmaster. Operating
under the guise of popular, elaborate spectacles, these groups use their
performances to mask their true mission: serving as mobile militias
dedicated to the protection of the populace. The cover of being a circus
not only allows them to move freely from town to town but also provides
a legitimate means of funding their operations. However, this dual life
places them in a precarious position with local law enforcement and
governments. While their efforts are instrumental in keeping communities
safe from the unseen dangers of Phantoms, and there are laws in place
allowing what would otherwise be vigilantism, the freedom they have in
actions and travels — and the reliance upon them this generates—makes
them a controversial force to some. The surge in circus popularity
provided the perfect opportunity to cement their legal status, yet that
is also exactly what amplified the tension between the circuses and the
authorities, who view them with suspicion and wariness, despite their
undeniable contributions to public safety. This fragile relationship
sets the stage for a world where trust is scarce, and danger is
ever-present.</p>

institute as it is a spectacle. Every act is a puzzle, every illusion a
layered message: how do you fight what you cannot comprehend?.</p>
