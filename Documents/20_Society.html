<h3 id="society-the-world-of-cirque-electrique"><strong>14. Society: The
World of Cirque Electrique</strong></h3>
<h4 id="overview"><strong>Overview</strong></h4>
<p>The society of Cirque Electrique is a study in contrasts—a world
where technological marvels and grim realities coexist in a delicate and
often perilous balance. As humanity teeters on the edge of an industrial
revolution powered by the dark energies of the Realm of the Damned,
every aspect of life is touched by the tension between progress and
survival. From the sprawling, fortified cities to the haunted wastelands
beyond, the people of this world navigate a landscape fraught with
danger, inequality, and the ever-present threat of Phantom attacks.
Sexism and racism has, for the most part, faded from society. There are
still some who refuse to let go of hatred, but for many, the reality has
become that contributions to Wards, protection from Phantoms, and
resources determine one's real value, rather than outdated notions of
race and gender.</p>
<p>This document explores the key facets of life in Cirque Electrique,
including the environment, economy, health, politics, and more.</p>
<h4 id="social-hierarchy-and-workforce-distribution"><strong>Social
Hierarchy and Workforce Distribution</strong></h4>
<p><strong>The Wealthy Elite (Nobles, Wealthy Industrialists, and
High-Ranking Officials)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Roles:</strong> The elite class consists of nobles,
wealthy industrialists, and high-ranking government or military
officials. They own large factories, mines, and other key industries,
holding significant influence over political decisions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Economic Involvement:</strong> The elite are deeply
entrenched in the economic system but largely removed from day-to-day
operations, focusing on accumulating wealth, maintaining power, and
engaging in high society.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Privileges:</strong> The elite enjoy unparalleled
privileges, with access to the most advanced Electrique devices, refined
Ether, and luxurious lifestyles. They reside in heavily fortified
estates with private Wards and personal security forces, controlling
much of society's wealth and power.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Middle Class (Merchants, Managers, Skilled Workers, and
Artificers)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Roles:</strong> The middle class includes skilled
workers, artisans, technomancers, artificers, and managers who oversee
the production of goods. They are responsible for maintaining Electrique
devices and running the day-to-day operations of factories, farms, and
workshops.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Economic Involvement:</strong> The middle class serves as
the backbone of the economy, managing the production and distribution of
goods. They operate small to medium-sized businesses, providing goods
and services to both the elite and the working class.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Privileges:</strong> The middle class holds a comfortable
position, benefiting from better-quality Aetherial Engines and stable
incomes. They make weekly contributions to their local Wards and often
work in professions tied to Technomancy, Aetherial Sciences, or other
specialized fields.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Working Class (Laborers, Farmers, and Low-Skilled
Workers)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Roles:</strong> The working class forms the largest
segment of society, comprising laborers, farmers, factory workers, and
those involved in resource extraction. They perform the hard, manual
labor required to produce essential goods.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Economic Involvement:</strong> The working class is the
engine of the economy, providing the manpower needed to keep the cities
running. They work long hours in dangerous conditions, with their labor
primarily benefiting the elite class.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Privileges:</strong> The working class occupies a
precarious but essential role in society. They have more stability than
the poor but live with the constant pressure of maintaining their daily
needs. They contribute to neighborhood Wards daily, using Copper
Aetherium to secure protection from Phantoms.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Poor</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Roles:</strong> The poor often have no steady employment
and survive by taking on menial jobs, scavenging, or relying on charity.
They live in the most dangerous areas, vulnerable to Phantom attacks and
environmental hazards.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Economic Involvement:</strong> The poor have little
involvement in the formal economy and often rely on the informal economy
to survive. They barter, trade in black markets, and perform illegal
work to meet their basic needs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Privileges:</strong> The poor are the most vulnerable
class, living day-to-day with barely enough resources to survive. They
rely heavily on community Wards for protection, contributing whatever
they can, whenever they can. Life in these neighborhoods is harsh, with
survival depending on communal efforts to maintain Wards against Phantom
incursions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Aetherial Class (Wardens, Technomancers, Alchemists,
Arcanists, Artificers, etc.)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Roles:</strong> This class consists of specialized
individuals responsible for overseeing the operation of Wards, the
refinement of Ether, the creation of Electrique devices, and other
advanced practices. Wardens, in particular, are solely responsible for
ensuring that Wards are operational.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Social Status:</strong> While the Aetherial class is
small, it occupies a unique position in society. They are often seen as
a blend of the working and middle classes but are treated with a degree
of reverence similar to that afforded to religious scholars. Their
expertise and roles are vital to the functioning and protection of
society, giving them a distinct status.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Economic Involvement:</strong> Members of the Aetherial
class often hold key positions in industries related to the refinement
and use of Ether. While they may not own large businesses, their skills
are in high demand, granting them stable livelihoods and
influence.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="social-dynamics"><strong>Social Dynamics</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Class Tensions<br />
</strong>Cirque Electrique’s society is rigidly stratified into five
distinct classes: the Wealthy Elite, the Middle Class, the Working
Class, the Poor, and the Aetherial Class. Each class lives in a vastly
different reality, with unique challenges and privileges.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Between the Elite and the Poor:</strong> The divide
between the elite and the poor is vast, with the former often
disconnected from the struggles of the latter. The poor resent the
elite's excesses and their ability to insulate themselves from the harsh
realities of the world. This resentment is mitigated by the need for
protection from Phantoms, which the elite can provide through their
wealth and control of Wards.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Between the Middle Class and the Working Class:</strong>
The middle class sees themselves as a step above the working class,
enjoying more security and better living conditions. However, they are
acutely aware of their vulnerability—one misstep could see them descend
into the working class or poverty. This creates a mix of sympathy and
disdain, with the middle class sometimes advocating for reforms but more
often seeking to protect their own status.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Between the Working Class and the Poor:</strong> The
working class looks down on the poor, seeing them as failures in a
system that, while harsh, does offer a path to survival. However, there
is also a degree of solidarity, as both groups share the struggle
against the oppressive structures of society. The working class is
always conscious of the need to maintain their status, knowing that a
slip could land them among the poor.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Between the Aetherial Class and the Rest:</strong> The
Aetherial class is respected for their expertise but often viewed with
suspicion or awe. Their work is critical for maintaining the Wards and
technologies that keep society functioning, giving them significant
influence. However, their aloofness and specialized knowledge create a
sense of distance from the rest of society, leading to tension and
mistrust.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mechanisms of Control</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Legal and Cultural Norms:</strong> Society is held
together by a combination of legal structures, cultural expectations,
and the ever-present need for protection from Phantoms. The elite use
their wealth to influence laws and maintain order, while the middle and
working classes adhere to strict social norms to avoid falling afoul of
the system.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Surveillance and Social Pressure:</strong> In
working-class neighborhoods, social pressure plays a significant role in
maintaining order. Everyone watches everyone else to ensure that Ward
contributions are made and that no one shirks their responsibilities.
The poor, however, operate differently. Here, the community understands
that everyone’s life is on the line, so there is less need to monitor
contributions. Instead, there is a shared understanding that everyone is
doing their best, given their limited resources. In higher-class areas,
appearances are crucial, with social standing tied to one’s ability to
contribute visibly and regularly to community Wards.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Police and Law Enforcement:</strong> The government’s
police force primarily exists to protect the interests and properties of
the wealthy elite. They are tasked with keeping the peace and ensuring
the social order remains intact, particularly by preventing the poor and
working classes from causing disturbances. However, the police are not
actively out on the streets looking to stir up trouble with the lower
classes. They focus on protecting the rich and their property, and a big
part of that is keeping the peace. The working class and poor do not
trust the police, seeing them as enforcers of the elite’s will rather
than protectors of the common people, but they recognize that the
police’s presence can help keep the worst chaos at bay.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rebellion and Dissent:</strong> Rebellion is rare but not
unheard of. Those who challenge the system face severe consequences,
including exile, imprisonment, or worse. The government and elite use a
combination of propaganda, law enforcement, and, when necessary, brute
force to suppress dissent. Secret police or surveillance networks may
monitor potential threats, ensuring that those who might incite
rebellion are dealt with swiftly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Surveillance and Propaganda:</strong> The government
employs a range of surveillance measures to monitor the population,
especially in working-class and middle-class areas where dissent is more
likely. This includes informants, spies, and possibly mechanical
surveillance devices, such as clockwork automatons, designed to keep
tabs on the public without drawing too much attention. Propaganda is
also widely used to maintain control, promoting loyalty to the
government and discrediting those who oppose the state. The government
carefully controls the flow of information, shaping public perception to
ensure that the population remains compliant.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Booming Economy:</strong> The exploitation of Phantasmal
energy has led to economic growth, but this prosperity is unevenly
distributed. The rich grow richer, enjoying the luxuries afforded by
Ether, while the poor are left to scrape by.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fortified Worker-Cities:</strong> Around resource
extraction sites, entire cities have been built to house workers. These
settlements are heavily fortified with Wards to protect against Phantom
attacks, but they are grim places where workers live under constant
threat.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Social Divide:</strong> The reliance on Ether has
deepened the divide between the wealthy elite and the impoverished
masses. The rich control the flow of Ether and the resources it powers,
while the poor suffer from blackouts, water shortages, and the constant
threat of Phantom attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Phantom Attacks: As cities grow increasingly dependent on
Ether, they also become more vulnerable to Phantom attacks. These
attacks exacerbate social tensions, as the poor are often left
unprotected while the rich enjoy the safety of Warded
enclaves.</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="health-and-disease"><strong>Health and Disease</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Phantasmal Sickness:</strong> Caused by prolonged
exposure to Phantasmal energies, this affliction leads to both physical
and mental decay. Victims are often ostracized, feared to be on the
verge of becoming Phantoms themselves. This sickness is as prevalent as
Tuberculosis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ethereal Poisoning:</strong> Resulting from intense
exposure to Ether, this condition causes debilitating headaches,
physical weakness, and eventual insanity. It serves as a grim reminder
that even humanity’s greatest tool can turn against them. It occurs with
about 1/100th the frequency of Phantasmal Sickness.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mental Illness:</strong> The constant fear of Phantom
attacks and the oppressive conditions of industrial life have led to
widespread mental illness, particularly among the poor. Paranoia,
depression, and madness are common, further destabilizing
society.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Limited Medical Care:</strong> Access to medical care is
heavily restricted by social class. The wealthy can afford treatments
and protections, while the poor often rely on dangerous and unregulated
remedies, if they have access to care at all.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="politics-and-governance"><strong>Politics and
Governance</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Elite Control:</strong> The ruling class maintains a
tight grip on power, using their control of Ether and Wards to enforce
their will. Political corruption is rampant, with the elite manipulating
resources and information to maintain their dominance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Public Distrust:</strong> The general population is
increasingly distrustful of both the ruling class and law enforcement.
This distrust fuels unrest and rebellion, as people grow weary of living
under constant threat while those in power remain insulated.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Suppression of Dissent:</strong> Any attempts to
challenge the status quo are met with swift and brutal repression. The
elite use their control of Wards and Ether to silence opposition,
ensuring that their hold on power remains unchallenged.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="technological-advancement"><strong>Technological
Advancement</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Ether-Driven Innovation:</strong> The discovery of Ether
has fueled a technological revolution, leading to the creation of
advanced machines and devices. However, these innovations are heavily
reliant on a constant supply of Ether, making them both powerful and
precarious.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Device Maintenance:</strong> Electrique devices, while
marvels of engineering, require constant maintenance and Ether to
function. This reliance on a finite resource has led to concerns about
the sustainability of technological progress.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dangerous Experiments:</strong> The drive to harness more
power from Ether has led to increasingly dangerous experiments.
Laboratories and workshops are often sites of catastrophic accidents,
creating new threats even as they push the boundaries of what is
possible.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> The benefits of technological
advancement are unevenly distributed. The wealthy have access to the
latest and greatest devices, while the poor are left with outdated or
malfunctioning technology.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="social-inequality-and-unrest"><strong>Social Inequality and
Unrest</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Widening Divide:</strong> The rich live in luxury,
protected by town guards and supplied with abundant Ether, while the
poor struggle to survive. This stark contrast has led to growing
resentment and anger among the lower classes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Riots and Strikes:</strong> Social unrest is on the rise,
with riots, strikes, and uprisings becoming increasingly
common.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Class Conflict:</strong> The tension between the classes
is palpable, with the poor blaming the rich for their suffering. This
conflict is exacerbated by the uneven distribution of resources and the
constant threat of Phantom attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Resistance Movements:</strong> In response to the growing
inequality, resistance movements have begun to form. These groups seek
to challenge the power of the elite and reclaim control over the
resources that sustain their world.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="education-and-knowledge-control"><strong>Education and Knowledge
Control</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Restricted Knowledge:</strong> The ruling class controls
access to knowledge, particularly in the field of Aetherics. The poor
are kept in ignorance, with their education limited to what is necessary
to maintain the status quo.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Elite Education:</strong> Only the wealthy have access to
the true knowledge of Ether and Phantasmal energy. This knowledge is
closely guarded and used to maintain their power and control over
society.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Misinformation:</strong> The elite use their control of
information to spread misinformation, keeping the population fearful and
compliant. Myths and superstitions are encouraged, further entrenching
the power of the ruling class.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Underground Learning:</strong> Despite the restrictions,
underground networks of scholars and educators have emerged, seeking to
share forbidden knowledge with the masses. These networks are constantly
under threat from the authorities, but they persist in their efforts to
challenge the status quo.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="food"><strong>Food</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Urban Gardens and Vertical Farms:</strong> Within the
safety of city walls, urban gardening has become a widespread practice.
Rooftop gardens, greenhouses, and vertical farms are common sights in
the wealthier districts, where the rich can afford the latest Electrique
technology to enhance growth rates and protect crops from the elements.
These urban farms are powered by Ether-infused devices that regulate
temperature, provide artificial sunlight, and ward off pests. However,
the poor often have to rely on more rudimentary methods, growing what
they can in small, shared spaces with minimal protection.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wards Protecting Farmlands:</strong> To expand beyond the
crowded city centers, some cities have extended Wards to encompass
nearby farmlands. These Wards are crucial for protecting crops from
Phantom incursions but are expensive and difficult to maintain. As a
result, only the wealthiest cities or regions can afford to keep large
swathes of farmland secure. In less affluent areas, farming outside the
city walls is a perilous endeavor, with farmers constantly at risk of
Phantom attacks. These farmlands are often operated by desperate or
marginalized groups, with produce being smuggled back into the cities
under cover of darkness.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Subterranean Farming:</strong> In some cities,
particularly those with limited space or where above-ground farming is
too dangerous, subterranean farms have been developed. These underground
facilities use advanced Electrique lighting systems and hydroponics to
grow crops. While effective, this method is energy-intensive and costly,
making it a resource primarily for the elite. The poor may have access
to these farms as laborers but rarely see the benefits of the produce
grown there.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Imported Goods and Trade:</strong> Trade between cities
is fraught with danger due to the Phantom-infested territories between
them, but it remains a vital part of city life. Well-guarded caravans
and airships, often operated by the larger circuses or mercenary groups,
transport food and other essential goods. However, these imports are
expensive and contribute to the stark divide between the haves and
have-nots. The rich enjoy exotic and diverse foods, while the poor
subsist on whatever local, lower-quality produce is available.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Synthetic Foods and Rationing:</strong> In response to
the food scarcity, some cities have turned to synthetic foods, created
through alchemical processes or advanced Electrique technologies. These
foods are often bland and nutritionally basic but provide a vital
resource for the urban poor. Rationing is also a common practice, with
strict controls over the distribution of food in times of crisis,
further emphasizing the disparity between social classes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Black Markets and Food Theft:</strong> The scarcity and
danger associated with food production have given rise to black markets
where stolen or illicitly grown food is traded. These markets are a
lifeline for the poor but are heavily policed by authorities trying to
maintain control over food supplies. Food theft is a common crime, and
those caught face severe punishment, highlighting the desperation and
lawlessness that permeate life in the lower echelons of
society.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Electrique Enhancements:</strong> For the wealthy,
Ether-infused culinary devices have become status symbols. These devices
can prepare food in extraordinary ways, enhancing flavors, preserving
freshness, and even creating elaborate meals from basic ingredients.
Such luxuries are far beyond the reach of the poor, who often struggle
just to secure their next meal.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ether as Currency</strong></p>
<p><strong>T</strong>he Role of Ether as Currency</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ether as Pax Aetherium: In the world of Cirque Electrique, Ether
serves as both a vital energy source and a universally accepted
currency. When solidified, Ether is minted into coins of varying purity,
collectively known as Pax Aetherium, The Opal Standard. These coins are
the foundation of the economy, facilitating transactions and serving as
a measure of wealth. The different grades of Ether determine the value
of the coins.</p></li>
<li><p>Aetherium Grades:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Crude Aetherium (Copper Coin):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Value: 0.01 Opals</p></li>
<li><p>Appearance: Copper in color, these coins represent the most basic
and least refined form of Ether. They are common in everyday
transactions, especially among the working class and the poor.</p></li>
<li><p>Usage: Crude Ether is frequently used for minor purchases, such
as daily necessities. The low value of these coins makes them accessible
to the majority of the population.</p></li>
<li><p>Production: Produced through a basic distillation process, Crude
Ether captures Phantasmal energies with minimal refinement. These coins
are easy to create, making them widely available.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Distilled Ether (Cobalt Coin):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Value: 0.10 Opals</p></li>
<li><p>Appearance: These coins are a deep cobalt blue, symbolizing a
more refined and stable form of Ether compared to Crude Ether. They are
more valuable and durable, making them suitable for larger
transactions.</p></li>
<li><p>Usage: Distilled Ether is commonly used by the middle class for
more significant purchases, such as higher-quality goods and
services.</p></li>
<li><p>Production: Created through an additional distillation process,
Distilled Ether is more stable and potent. The increased complexity in
production raises the value and demand for these coins.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Refined Ether (Opal Coin):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Value: 1 Opal</p></li>
<li><p>Appearance: A shimmering opalescent coin, reflecting a high
degree of refinement and purity. These coins are rare and highly sought
after.</p></li>
<li><p>Usage: Refined Ether is used for substantial transactions,
savings, and investments, particularly among the upper-middle class and
elite.</p></li>
<li><p>Production: Refined Ether is produced through an intensive
purification process, resulting in a very pure and valuable form of
Ether. The process is complex, making these coins both rare and
valuable.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Pure Ether (Gold Coin):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Value: 10 Opals</p></li>
<li><p>Appearance: A lustrous, silvery-gold coin with a faint glow,
representing the pinnacle of Ether purity. These coins are the most
valuable and are symbols of great wealth.</p></li>
<li><p>Usage: Gold Coins are reserved for the most significant
transactions, such as large property purchases, high-stakes investments,
or as reserves of wealth. They are primarily held by the wealthiest
individuals and institutions.</p></li>
<li><p>Production: The creation of Pure Ether (Gold Coins) involves the
most sophisticated and precise refinement process, making them
exceptionally rare and valuable. Only the most skilled Aetherical can
produce these coins.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Standardization and Exchange</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Standardization:</strong> Each Pax Aetherium is
standardized in size and volume, ensuring consistency in transactions
and making it easier to measure the exchange rate between different
grades. The purity of the Ether determines the color and value of the
coin, allowing for easy identification and use in trade. Coins can be
subdivided or combined as needed, maintaining the fluidity and
flexibility of the currency.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Economic Impact:</strong> The widespread use of Ether as
currency ties the economy directly to the availability and refinement of
Phantasmal energies. As Ether is both a currency and a power source,
there is a constant demand for it, driving both production and
consumption. Aetherial Engines, devices that collect and distill
Phantasmal energies into Ether, are common among those who can afford
them. These engines allow individuals to produce their own currency,
which can be used for daily expenses or traded for higher grades of
Ether.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Class and Currency</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Economic Stratification:</strong> The use of different
grades of Ether coins reflects the social hierarchy within Cirque
Electrique. The working class predominantly uses Crude Ether (Copper
Coins), while the middle class deals more frequently in Distilled Ether
(Cobalt Coins). The upper class, with their greater wealth and access to
advanced Aetherical technologies, primarily uses Refined Ether (Opal
Coins) and Pure Ether (Gold Coins). This stratification of currency use
reinforces the social divide, with access to higher-grade Ether being a
clear indicator of one's social standing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Economic Participation and Government Fees:</strong>
Participation in government services is charged on a per-transaction
basis, with fees based on the complexity and urgency of the transaction.
This method of funding the government adds to the general resentment
toward law enforcement and politicians, as citizens feel burdened by the
high costs of essential services like police and fire
protection.</p></li>

id="cirque-electrique-major-european-city-states-post-rift-arcologies"><strong>Cirque
Electrique: Major European City-States (Post-Rift
Arcologies)</strong></h3>
<p>In 1863, the rifts opened to the Realm of the Damned, unleashing
Phantoms that devastated the European continent. For several years,
humanity had no defenses—only fear, flight, and overwhelming loss. By
1866, rudimentary Wards began to emerge, and by 1867, the discovery of
Aether—refined from Phantasmal energy—accelerated the development of
defensive technologies. With growing mastery of Ward construction,
survivors began to gather and rebuild.</p>
<p>Naturally, people gravitated toward the places they remembered—major
cities—where cultural memory and surviving infrastructure offered hope.
These cities grew into <strong>fortified arcologies</strong>, enclosed
by increasingly powerful Ward networks. Beyond their perimeters lies a
world abandoned to the Phantoms: a corrupted wilderness too dangerous
and too depopulated to reclaim. In this new age, only a handful of
city-states remain, flickering like stars against an encroaching
darkness.</p>
