Aetherium is the lifeblood of the economy and energy infrastructure in
Cirque Electrique. These coins are produced by Aetherial Engines,
devices that absorb ambient Phantasmal energies, distill and purify
them, and solidify the refined energy into coin-shaped ingots. Each type
of Pax Aetherium reflects a different level of refinement, with
higher-grade engines producing more valuable coins. The decentralized
production of these coins, along with their direct utility as an energy
source to power Wards and other Electrique Devices, has made Pax
Aetherium the primary currency throughout all of Humanity. Below is a
detailed description of the four types of Pax Aetherium. The Opal
Aetherium is considered the standard, and the other Pax Aetherium are
measured against it for comparative value.</h3>

high-stakes financial endeavors.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cost-of-living-economic-structure-and-class-dynamics"><strong>Cost
of Living: Economic Structure and Class Dynamics</strong></h3>
<p>The society of Cirque Electrique is deeply stratified, with a rigid
hierarchy that determines access to resources, technology, and basic
necessities. The wealthy elite enjoy a life of luxury, insulated from
the harsh realities of the world by their wealth and control over Wards
and Ether resources. The middle class, while more comfortable, still
faces the constant pressure to maintain their status, balancing their
income with the costs of keeping up appearances. The working class,
forming the backbone of the economy, labors long hours in dangerous
conditions, earning just enough to survive and contribute to daily Ward
fees that protect them from Phantom attacks. The poor, on the other
hand, live a precarious existence, relying on communal efforts to
maintain Wards and survive day-to-day.</p>
<h3 id="living-conditions-and-standards"><strong>Living Conditions and
Standards</strong></h3>
<p>The cost of living varies significantly across the social strata. For
the working class, expenses such as housing, food, utilities, and
contributions to neighborhood Wards are essential but burdensome.
Electrique devices like the EtherGlow Orbs and AetherLift Apparatus are
limited luxuries, used sparingly to conserve Pax Aetherium. Middle-class
families, while more comfortable, still prioritize spending on
maintaining their status, with greater access to Electrique devices and
better living conditions. The elite, by contrast, have access to the
finest technologies and enjoy a life of excess, with their cost of
living reflecting the high price of luxury and security.</p>
<h3 id="social-expectations-and-class-behavior"><strong>Social
Expectations and Class Behavior</strong></h3>
<p>Social norms and expectations heavily influence spending patterns.
The middle class is acutely aware of the need to present themselves
well, often spending a significant portion of their income on clothing,
personal Wards, and other status symbols. The working class, while
focused on survival, also faces social pressures to contribute to
communal Wards and maintain a basic standard of living. The poor, with
little to no disposable income, often operate in informal economies,
bartering and relying on community support to meet their needs. The
disparity in income and cost of living across the classes creates a
clear delineation between those who can afford to enjoy the benefits of
technological progress and those who struggle to survive.</p>
<h3 id="technological-impact-and-accessibility"><strong>Technological
Impact and Accessibility</strong></h3>
<p>Electrique devices play a crucial role in everyday life, but their
accessibility varies greatly by class. The elite have the means to own
and operate the most advanced technologies, while the middle class can
afford a moderate range of devices, balancing utility and cost. The
working class, however, must carefully ration their use of Electrique
devices, prioritizing essential functions like lighting and
transportation while forgoing more specialized or luxury items. The
poor, largely excluded from the benefits of these technologies, rely on
rudimentary tools and communal resources to get by.</p>
<h3 id="regional-and-urban-variations"><strong>Regional and Urban
Variations</strong></h3>
<p>The distribution of resources and technology also varies by region
and city-state. Wealthier cities with stronger economies and more robust
Wards can offer better living conditions and access to technology for
their residents, particularly the middle and upper classes. In contrast,
poorer or more isolated areas may struggle with limited access to
Electrique devices, higher costs of living, and greater vulnerability to
Phantom attacks. The economic and social divide is not just vertical
(between classes) but also horizontal, with regional disparities further
complicating the landscape of Cirque Electrique.</p>
