<p><strong>Ether: A Vital Force in the World of Cirque
Electrique</strong></p>
<h3 id="overview"><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
<p>Ether, the lifeblood of the Cirque Electrique world, originates from
a source as dark as it is potent—Phantasmal energy. The discovery of
Ether emerged from the chaotic aftermath of dozens of experiment,
performed in 1867, rushing to find a way to harness phantasmal energy to
use it against the phantoms. When researchers completed Dr. Helena
Mercurial’s “purfication formula,” they found themselves holding an
entirely new, high-energy fluid capable of extraordinary effects. They
named this fluid Ether, recognizing its potential as a power source
unlike any other.</p>
<p>Initially, the discovery of Ether was hailed as a breakthrough. Early
experiments revealed its ability to power machines, enhance physical
objects, and even create effects that defied the known laws of physics.
As scientists and engineers continued to study and refine this
substance, the field of Aetherics was born, encompassing all research
and application of Ether. It was during this time that the various
branches of Aetheric study began to take shape—Arcana, Technomancy,
Alchemy, and Warding.</p>
<p>However, the initial excitement surrounding Ether soon gave way to a
grim realization. The only way to produce Ether was by refining
Phantasmal energy, the essence of entities from the Realm of the Damned.
These phantasms, drawn to places of suffering and death, are themselves
embodiments of horror and malevolence. To fuel their growing dependence
on Ether, humanity had to harvest this dark energy, perpetuating a cycle
of horror where the very source of their power was rooted in that which
tormented them.</p>
<p>This dependence has led to a bleak paradox. As the demand for Ether
grew, so too did the need for a steady supply of Phantasmal energy. The
pursuit of technological advancement and economic growth became
inextricably tied to the harvesting of this malevolent force. Now, the
cities and circuses of Cirque Electrique are locked in a grim cycle of
consumption, where the success and survival of the human race depend on
the continuous exploitation of an energy that seeks to destroy them.</p>
<p>In this dystopian reality, Ether is both a blessing and a curse. It
powers the machines and defenses that keep the phantoms at bay, but it
also ties humanity to a source of power that threatens to consume them
entirely. The relentless pursuit of Ether has driven society to the
brink, where the lines between progress and damnation blur. For those
who understand the true cost of Ether, the world of Cirque Electrique is
one where death offers no escape—only an eternity of torment, unless
one's soul is fed into the relentless gears of industrial progress.</p>
<p>As the world continues to advance technologically, the moral and
existential implications of Ether use grow ever darker. The very power
that fuels society's greatest achievements also underpins its deepest
horrors, creating a nightmarish existence where every victory against
the phantoms comes at an immeasurable cost. In the shadows of this grand
spectacle, a dark truth looms: humanity's brightest lights are powered
by its darkest fears.</p>
<p>This ominous reality, whether seen or not by its inhabitants, has
given rise to a variety of practitioners, each specializing in the
manipulation and application of Ether in distinct ways. These
individuals, driven by necessity and ambition, have developed their own
schools of thought and practice, each with its own methods and moral
dilemmas. As the world grows more dependent on Ether, these
practitioners stand at the forefront of both its promises and its
perils, shaping the future of a world teetering on the edge of
oblivion.</p>
<p><strong>Phantasmal and Aetheric Sicknesses</strong></p>
<p>The overexposure to either Phantasmal energies or Ether is not
without consequences, manifesting in two distinct afflictions:
Phantasmal Sickness and Aetheric Sickness.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Phantasmal Sickness</strong> occurs when individuals are
exposed to Phantasmal energies for too long or at too intense a level.
This affliction is characterized by a range of symptoms, from persistent
nightmares and hallucinations to physical decay, making victims appear
as though they are becoming Phantoms themselves. It’s a condition that
sows fear and isolation, with no known cure. At this time, it is as
prevalent as Tuberculosis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Aetheric Poisoning</strong> results from prolonged or
intense exposure to Ether. Victims suffer from severe headaches,
weakening of the body, and eventual mental degradation. Though less
common, this condition is deeply feared as it represents the dark side
of humanity’s reliance on Ether, reminding everyone that even their
greatest defense carries a deadly cost. It occurs at about 1/100th the
rate of Phantasmal Sicness.</p></li>

<p><strong>Applications of Ether:</strong></p>

<section><p><strong>Arcana:</strong></p><li><p><strong>Practitioners:</strong> Arcanists</p></li><li><p><strong>Description:</strong> Arcana is the application of Ether
through a modular conduit, instead of requiring fixed Aetheric
circuitry. In essence, the Arcanist is capable of calculating on the fly
what other Ether manipulators must prepare in advance. The Arcanist is
also able to directly consume Ether to fuel their conduit. This skill
has been likened to the casting of magical spells, if others are
imagined to be the use of magic items or potions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ranks:</strong> Apprentice, Adept, Magus,
Archmage</p></li></section><section><p><strong>Alchemy:</strong></p><li><p><strong>Practitioners:</strong> Alchemists</p></li><li><p><strong>Description:</strong> Alchemy is the art of infusing
Ether into herbal, mineral, and chemical compounds, resulting in
mixtures with seemingly magical properties. Alchemists combine the
natural energies of these ingredients with Ether to create potions,
oils, bombs, and other concoctions that can produce powerful and varied
effects.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ranks:</strong> Mixer, Concocter, Brewmaster,
Transmuter</p></li></section><section><p><strong>Technomancy:</strong></p><li><p><strong>Practitioners:</strong> Technomancers</p></li><li><p><strong>Description:</strong> Technomancy involves integrating
Ether-powered circuitry into mechanical, clockwork, or electric devices
to enhance or empower their functions. The manner in which Ether is
embedded within the device determines the nature of its enhancement. For
instance, applying Ether to a device's frame increases durability, while
using Ether to power a fan improves the cooling effect. However, the
Ether within these devices is consumed with use. Pax Aetherium coins are
the standard way of resupplying Ether, and all Electrique devices have
Pax slots for refueling.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ranks:</strong> Tinkerer, Mechanist, Engineer,
Architect</p></li></section><section><p><strong>Wards:</strong></p><li><p><strong>Practitioners:</strong> Wardens</p></li><li><p><strong>Description:</strong> Wardens specialize in using Ether
to manipulate local energy fields to create various effects. The most
prominent calling card of the Wardens are Wards: Electrique devices that
produce anti-phantasmal energy waves that create a shield-like bubbles
of Aetheric energy, keeping Phantoms out of living areas. Wardens are
specialists in creating and maintaining these and other fields of
energy. Wards are essential for the defense of major cities and Big Top
circuses, which maintain Wards capable of shielding entire areas. Given
the importance of this ability, skilled Wardens are in extremely high
demand.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ranks:</strong> Keeper, Guardian, Sentinel,
Aegis.</p></li></section><section><p><strong>Artificing (Non-Wildcard Only):</strong></p><li><p><strong>Practitioners:</strong> Artificers</p></li><li><p><strong>Description:</strong> Artificers specialize in building
Aetheric machinery that duplicates and mass produces original
Technomantic devices. Artificers feed their Ether into Electrique
assembly chains to produce multiple replicas in a fraction of the time,
albeit at proportionately lower quality. The Artificers’ ability to
bring Electrique devices into the hands of many is highly valued at
multiple levels of society.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ranks:</strong> Assembler, Joiner, Constructor,
Fabricator</p></li></section>
