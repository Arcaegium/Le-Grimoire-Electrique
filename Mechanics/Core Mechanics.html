  <h3>Grimdark</h3>
  <p>Don’t get overly attached. All characters are at risk of permanent death.</p>
  <h3>Race</h3>
  <p>Only Human.</p>
  <h3>Rolls before descriptions</h3>
  <p>Play the Role defined by your Roll.</p>
  <h3>Troupe</h3> Only Human. <strong>Rolls before descriptions.</strong> Play the Role defined by your Roll.</p>
  <h3>Troupe</h3>

  Everyone will start with one performer in the troupe, but the goal is to build a large troupe of playable characters for you to choose from as you expand your circus. When there are more performers than there are players, any player may choose to play any performer that is not currently being played by someone else.</p>
  <h3>Faith</h3>

  On a daily basis, this world experiences malevolent spirit-like entities, dubbed “Phantoms,” that come from a place named “The Realm of the Damned.” To date, there has been zero proof or even indication that any counterpart exists for the “other team.” As such, it has become the common belief that not only is life after death guaranteed, but it is a guaranteed eternal torment. This has convinced some that there is no longer reason to be good. Others, that the world is too full of sinners to save. Others still, that they must strive even harder to prove their faith. Yet, there are also those who remind us that we are the ones who named them, and we still don’t really know what they are or what is really going on.</p>
  <h3>Ether</h3>

  Phantoms radiate phantasmal energy, and they leave phantasmal residue. One of the biggest discoveries post-damnation was that phantasmal energies and residue can be distilled and purified into a type of super-fuel, named Ether, that allows mechanical and electrical devices to function in ways previously unheard of. Aetherial Engines can gather phantasmal energies and refine Ether automatically, under two conditions: first, there must be a human bioelectric signal input into the device to keep it active. Second, as delicate as the Engine is, it must be kept relatively stable and still during its processing. As Ether explosions are particularly nasty, all Aetherial Engines have a safety measure built in that stops Ether production when they are jostled too much. The end result is that Aetherial Engines are only effective at producing Ether when they are being worn and when the wearer is resting.</p>
  <h3>Powers</h3>

  Every Star performer will require an Arcane Background. There are limited ways in which Powers can be expressed in-game, so in order to allow for full variety of characters, all Arcane Backgrounds are available, but Arcane Background selections are for mechanics only. All in-game explanations for Powers come from Aetherial Engines, which each Wild Card will automatically possess. This device is what generates 5 power points per hour of rest (or more with Edges). Regardless of which mechanic you choose to use, you must choose one of the “Trappings Types” to define how your magic appears in this world.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Arcanum:</strong> Direct application of Ether to create magical effects.</li>
    <li><strong>Alchemy:</strong> Infusion of Ether into potions, balms, and bombs.</li>
    <li><strong>Technomancy:</strong> Ether-powered mechanical devices.</li>
    <li><strong>Warding:</strong> Ether fields that repulse phantoms.</li>
    <li><strong>Artificing:</strong> NPCs only. Lower-quality replication of Technomancer creations.</li>
  </ul>

  The game will use a form of currency named Pax Aetherium, which is the solidified form of Ether, which comes from purifying Phantasmal energy. Pax Aetherium is a hierarchy of 4 coins. Copper (0.01), Cobalt (0.10), Opal (1.00), and Gold (10.00). In conversation, the terms “Pax” and “Opal” are used interchangeably as the common names for the currency. For conversion, 1 Opal in 1880 = $100 in the SWADE book. This is the same conversion rate as Weird West and Rippers, so prices in those themes do not need to be adjusted.</p>

  In this setting, Power Points take a physical form, that of Pax Aetherium, which is this world’s currency. 1 Power Point is equivalent to 1 Copper. This means Power Points in fact can be and are spent like money. In one action, you can insert your (throwing ROF) coins into an Electrique device to give it power. Once inserted, the coin is lost and the device retains the number of power points inserted into it until they are used. Using higher value coins can reduce the amount of time you spend “reloading.”</p>

  <h3>Skill Changes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Electriques:</strong> Use of Electrique devices, requires d6 or activation roll.</li>
    <li><strong>Mecaniques:</strong> Clockwork machinery construction.</li>
    <li><strong>Hacking:</strong> Reprogram or sabotage devices you didn’t build.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Optional Setting Rules</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>More Skill Points:</strong> Characters begin with 15 skill points during creation instead of the usual 12.</li>
    <li><strong>Born a Hero:</strong> Characters may select Edges during creation without regard to Rank requirements.</li>
    <li><strong>Wound Cap:</strong> No single hit may cause more than four Wounds.</li>
    <li><strong>Dumb Luck:</strong> Characters may spend a Benny to reroll a Critical Failure.</li>
    <li><strong>Fast Healing:</strong> Wild Cards make natural healing rolls every day instead of every five days.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Creative Combat</h3>
  <p>If a Wild Card character succeeds with a raise on a Test during combat, instead of automatically Shaking the foe, they may roll on the Creative Combat Table:</p>
  <h3>Creative Combat Table</h3>
  <table>
    <tr><th>2D6</th><th>Result</th></tr>
    <tr><td>2</td><td>Second Wind: The foe’s reaction gives your hero hope or allows her to catch her breath. She may remove a level of Fatigue or a Wound (her choice). If she doesn’t have Fatigue or Wounds, the enemy is Shaken instead.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>3</td><td>Inspiration: Fate favors the bold. The clever hero receives a Benny.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>4–5</td><td>Double Whammy: The target is both Distracted and Vulnerable.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>6–8</td><td>Shaken: The foe is Shaken.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>9–10</td><td>Setback: The target suffers a setback of some sort. She might fall off a ledge, lose the confidence of her minions, take a rash action, or lose her next action.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>11</td><td>Insight: The hero has new insight into the target’s nature. Once during this encounter, she may add +1d6 to any Trait roll made to directly attack, affect, or damage the same foe. If rolled a second time in the same encounter, the foe is Shaken instead.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>12</td><td>Seize the Moment: After the hero resolves this turn, she immediately gets an entire additional turn. This includes movement as well. She may use the turn to go on Hold if she wishes.</td></tr>
  </table>
