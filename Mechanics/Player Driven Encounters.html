  <h2>Player-Directed Encounters</h2>

  <p>In <em>Cirque Electrique</em>, players are not limited to predefined solutions. Each encounter is designed with multiple viable approaches, and it is up to the players to determine how the situation evolves. This system does not prioritize combat, exploration, social manipulation, or puzzles as dominant modes of play. Instead, it offers each as a potential tool, and encourages player creativity in choosing how and when to apply them.</p>

  <p>Encounters are built with layered structure but flexible resolution. There is no "intended" solution. There is only context, constraints, and consequence.</p>

  <p>Players might face:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A hostile Phantom infiltrating a warded neighborhood</li>
    <li>A volatile labor dispute between the working class and law enforcement</li>
    <li>A cursed object disrupting the balance of power in a city block</li>
    <li>A political figure showing signs of possession or corruption</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Each of these can be approached through any combination of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Combat – Neutralize the threat with force, tactics, and risk</li>
    <li>Social manipulation – Influence or redirect key figures to change conditions</li>
    <li>Investigation – Reveal hidden factors that reframe the scenario or unlock new options</li>
    <li>Technical engagement – Use Electriques, Mechaniques, or other skills to manipulate the environment or target</li>
    <li>Environmental control – Seal rifts, redirect energy flows, collapse unstable terrain</li>
    <li>Performance – Distract, awe, or uplift crowds to alter emotional conditions</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Shifting the Frame</h3>

  <p>Instead of being handed a challenge with an implied correct path, players are handed a volatile situation with enough friction to ignite something—but what catches fire, and how it burns, is up to them.</p>

  <p>A Phantom doesn't always need to be fought. It can be:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Starved by pacifying fear in the crowd</li>
    <li>Redirected through occult insight and timely rituals</li>
    <li>Immobilized by a clever use of technology</li>
    <li>Harmonically shattered via performances strong enough to evoke incredible emotional responses</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Player Responsibility</h3>

  <p>This structure places narrative responsibility on the players. The GM will not funnel them into a single solution path. Instead, the GM will expose pressure points and escalate tensions, and it is up to the troupe to determine what kind of story they are willing to step into.</p>

  <p>The outcome of any given encounter will reflect the type of characters present, the tools they choose to use, and the mindset they bring to the moment.</p>

  <p>In essence: the players don’t just decide what they <em>do</em>, they decide what kind of game they’re playing. And that choice happens every session, every scene.</p>
