  <h2>Glossary – Cirque Electrique</h2>

  <h3>Aetherial Engine</h3>
  <p>A wearable device that collects and distills Ether from ambient Phantasmal energy. It requires a steady bioelectric signal and stillness to function safely. When jostled, production halts to prevent explosive failure.</p>

  <h3>Aetheric Distillation</h3>
  <p>The process of purifying raw Phantasmal energy into usable Ether. This process removes malevolent taint and makes the energy safe for use in refined society.</p>

  <h3>Aetheric Resonance</h3>
  <p>The oscillating behavior of refined Ether when exposed to energy frequencies or nearby Phantasmal phenomena. It plays a role in device tuning and Electro-Spectra readings.</p>

  <h3>Apparition</h3>
  <p>A type of illusion powered by Electrique devices, capable of producing extremely convincing visual or auditory effects far beyond mundane trickery.</p>

  <h3>Cirque Electrique</h3>
  <p>The name of the world setting. A Gothic-Electropunk alternate 1870s Earth where Ether, Phantoms, and steampunk technologies coexist within a collapsing society clinging to hope through performance and invention.</p>

  <h3>Electrique</h3>
  <p>The in-world term for a fusion of Steampunk and Electropunk powered by Ether. It is not just functional—it is celebrated as an art form. Electrique devices dazzle with mechanical elegance and glowing arcane accents, becoming a symbol of status, taste, and power.</p>

  <h3>Electrique Devices</h3>
  <p>Technological creations powered by Ether. These machines are crafted to function beautifully and powerfully, often performing feats that appear magical while maintaining a mechanical form.</p>

  <h3>Electro-Spectra</h3>
  <p>The range of energetic frequencies measurable across Phantasmal and Etheric bands. Used to calibrate devices, detect rifts, and study energy fields.</p>

  <h3>Pax Aetherium</h3>
  <p>Solidified Ether used as both currency and fuel. It comes in four denominations: Copper (0.01), Cobalt (0.10), Opal (1.00), and Gold (10.00). One Power Point equals one Copper. These coins are consumed by Electrique devices and ward systems.</p>

  <h3>Phantasmal Flux</h3>
  <p>The instability and flow variation of phantasmal energy, often blamed for malfunctions in Electrique devices and dangerous environmental anomalies.</p>

  <h3>Phantasmal Residue</h3>
  <p>Residual energy left behind after a Phantom’s activity. It is dangerous in its raw state but can be collected for refinement into Ether.</p>

  <h3>Phantom</h3>
  <p>Malevolent, otherworldly entities originating from the Realm of the Damned. They are unpredictable, terrifying, and seen as the greatest threat to human existence. All Phantoms emit hazardous phantasmal energy and leave behind residue.</p>

  <h3>Realm of the Damned</h3>
  <p>The supposed origin of Phantoms—an eternal, torment-filled afterlife. While many accept its existence as fact, others question its nature or even its name.</p>

  <h3>Reputation</h3>
  <p>A currency representing fame, success, and credibility. Gained through performance, it is spent to upgrade the circus, expand the troupe, and unlock new capabilities.</p>

  <h3>Rift</h3>
  <p>A spatial breach where the Realm of the Damned intersects with the physical world. These distortions can alter local time, space, and sensory reality.</p>

  <h3>Side Act</h3>
  <p>A troupe of circus performers that has not been officially recognized as a circus.</p>

  <h3>Troupe</h3>
  <p>The collection of performers managed by players. The troupe grows over time, and characters are assigned to various duties like performances or missions during campaign play.</p>

  <h3>Ward</h3>
  <p>A protective energy field generated by consuming Pax Aetherium. Wards repel Phantoms and are essential for survival. Ward performance varies by the wealth of the district.</p>
