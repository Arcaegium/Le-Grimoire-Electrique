    Circus Management Rules – Cirque Electrique
   </h2>
   <p>
    In Cirque Electrique, players do not control individual characters. Instead, each player manages a small troupe of performers. The troupe begins with one performer per player and may undertake one Performance per day, with only one Act per Performance at the start.
   </p>
   <p>
    Players rotate which performers they play during missions or shows. Tasks are assigned each in-game day. Missions grant advancements to individual performers, while Performances increase the troupe’s Reputation, unlocking new capabilities. Chores sustain circus function and prevent penalties.
   </p>
   <p>
    Daily Assignment Loop
   </p>
   <h3>
    Each in-game day, every performer must be assigned to one of the following tasks:
   </h3>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Missions:
    </strong>
    Performer gains 1 Advancement if successful.
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Performance:
    </strong>
    Earn Reputation based on outcome.
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Chores:
    </strong>
    Maintain circus operations. Prevent penalties.
   </p>
   <p>
    A performer can only do one task per day. Those assigned to chores cannot perform or go on missions.
   </p>
   <p>
    Missions
   </p>
   <p>
    Each successful mission grants 1 Advancement to each participating performer.
   </p>
   <p>
    Advancements follow standard Savage Worlds rules.
   </p>
   <p>
    No Reputation is required to advance via missions.
   </p>

    Performance Mechanics Overview
   </p>
   <p>
    Act Structure
   </p>
   <p>
    Each Performance is composed of one or more Acts.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Each Act includes:
   </h3>
   <p>
    1 Lead Performer
   </p>
   <p>
    Any number of Supporting Performers (using Savage Worlds Support rules)
   </p>
   <p>
    Support Mechanics
   </p>
   <p>
    Each success or raise on a Support roll adds +1 to the Lead Performer’s roll (maximum of +4).
   </p>
   <p>
    If the Act theme matches an audience preference for the location, the Lead Performer gains an additional +2 bonus.
   </p>
   <p>
    Total modifier for Lead = up to +6.
   </p>
   <p>
    Performance Resolution Table
   </p>
   <p>
    Reputation from all Acts is totaled to determine the raw show result.
   </p>
   <p>
    Zone-Based Reputation Scaling
   </p>
   <h3>
    After totaling raw reputation, apply a multiplier based on the performance zone:
   </h3>
   <p>
    Upper Zone Tax: Players must spend 10 Rep prior to performing.
   </p>
   <p>
    The multiplier is applied after raw reputation is calculated.
   </p>
   <p>
    Morale &amp; Availability
   </p>
   <p>
    Performers left idle for 2 days become Demoralized: –1 to all Trait rolls.
   </p>
   <p>
    Penalty is removed after the performer works for a day.
   </p>
   <p>
    If Demoralized for 5 days, the performer may leave the troupe unless rallied by a successful social Test or reassigned.
   </p>
   <p>
    Reputation Upgrade Table – Troupe Upgrades

    Performance Upgrades

   <h3>
    Ward Upgrades
   </h3>
   <p>
    These penalties stack with other sources and apply only to Spirit checks during Phantom breach attempts.
   </p>
   <p>
    This structure ensures player decisions matter daily while rewarding both tactical optimization and narrative engagement.
